Egg Battle is fun and addicting puzzle game for everyone!

You have only one goal. Crack all the eggs on the screen!
To do so, tap on an egg to break it and to let it shoot out a "pop" in every direction to hit other eggs.
Sounds easy, right?
But beware, your moves are limited and some eggs need more hits than others.
So tap wisely.

Have fun!
